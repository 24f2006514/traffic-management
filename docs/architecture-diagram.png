ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM PLACEHOLDER

This would contain a visual diagram showing:
- Frontend (React SPA on Vercel)
- Backend (Node.js/Express on local machine)
- YOLO Service (Python on local machine)
- WebSocket connection between frontend and backend
- REST API calls from frontend to backend
- Camera/Video input to YOLO service
- Output: alerts → backend → frontend via WebSocket

For now, see demo-instructions.md for the flow overview.
